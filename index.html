			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				Hello! I'm Rutvik Gandhasri, a first year computer science student at UC Irvine.
				Check out my current <a href="https://sites.google.com/students.esuhsd.org/rutvikg-portfolio/home">portfolio</a>, 
				which will eventually be replaced by this website.

			<h1>Academic Interests</h1>

			<p>
				I have much to learn about in all of these subjects, but I'll get there eventually.
			</p>

			<ul>

				<li>
					<h2>Computer Science</h2>
					<p>
						Most interested in solving problems with computing to make humans' lives
						easier in one way or another. Currently exploring algorithms and the use of
						Python for data analysis. 
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h2>Linguistics</h2>
					<p>
						Primarily interested in syntax, natural language processing, and
						eventually bridging the gap between programming languages and
						human languages. Interest stemmed from participating in spelling
						bees growing up. Currently serving as a research assistant in the UCI
						Linguistics department (link soon!)
					</p>
				</li>
